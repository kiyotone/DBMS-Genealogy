# Genealogy Visualizer Project

## Frontend

This part of the project is built using **React**. It is responsible for visually displaying genealogy data in an interactive and user-friendly way. It allows users to view family trees, individual profiles, and relationships. The frontend fetches data from the backend API to render the family and relationship details dynamically.

For more details, please refer to the `frontend/README.md` file.

## Backend

The backend is built using **FastAPI** and serves as the API that handles requests related to genealogy data. It allows for managing families, people, events, and relationships, as well as fetching the necessary data for the frontend. The backend connects to a **PostgreSQL** database to store and retrieve data.

For more details, please refer to the `backend/README.md` file.
